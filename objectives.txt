Goal 1 – Analytical Excellence & Reproducibility

Objective:
Deliver fully accurate, reproducible analytics and dashboards for application fraud strategies.

Success measures:

Zero high-severity discrepancies identified after sharing key dashboards/analyses.

100% of BAU dashboards and major analyses supported by documented, version-controlled SQL/Python that others can reuse.

At least 3 major analyses/rule evaluations peer-reviewed and validated by a colleague.

Goal 2 – Fraud Strategy Impact (Rules & Loss Reduction)

Objective:
Design and optimize application fraud rules that materially reduce fraud loss while controlling false positives and customer impact.

Success measures:

Lead at least 1–2 new or significantly optimized rules/strategies with modeled annualized fraud loss reduction ≥ $X (to be agreed with manager).

Optimize or decommission at least 2 low-performing rules (e.g., poor detection, high FPs, or high ops burden).

Produce a simple one-pager for each rule (problem, approach, KPIs, savings, customer/ops impact, recommendation).

Goal 3 – Efficiency & Reusable Analytics (Automation)

Objective:
Improve team efficiency by building reusable tools and automation for fraud analytics and alert handling.

Success measures:

Deliver the automated tool that pulls credit cards associated with alerted applications and routes them to the block queue, with measurable fraud and/or ops benefits.

Automate or streamline at least 3 recurring manual analyses/reports, targeting ≥ 10 hours/month saved for the team.

Create a small library of reusable SQL/Python templates for performance evaluation and spike investigations, stored and documented in a shared location.

Goal 4 – Experimentation & Long-Term Strategy (Champion/Challenger)

Objective:
Bring structured experimentation and champion/challenger testing into application fraud strategy design.

Success measures:

Design and run at least 2 champion/challenger tests (e.g., new rules, thresholds, prioritization logic).

Align on a standard KPI set for tests (fraud savings, detection, FPs, customer impact, ops load).

Provide concise experiment readouts that lead to clear decisions (roll-out, refine, or retire).

Goal 5 – FIQM → FICO Migration & Platform Expertise

Objective:
Become a go-to SME for application fraud strategies in the FIQM to FICO migration.

Success measures:

Lead or co-lead migration and validation of 5–10 high-impact application fraud rules into FICO.

Document key differences, risks, and best practices for designing and monitoring application fraud rules in FICO.

Deliver at least 1 knowledge-sharing session on FICO usage for fraud rules/strategy.

Goal 6 – Communication, Visibility & Leadership

Objective:
Increase visibility and demonstrate leadership through storytelling, collaboration, and knowledge-sharing.

Success measures:

Continue to own and present the strategy performance dashboard to the larger forum, focusing on clear insight-driven narratives and recommended actions.

Lead at least 2 knowledge-sharing sessions within the fraud/analytics community at TD (e.g., fraud trends, new tools, champion/challenger results).

Act as the primary analytics/strategy contact on at least 1 cross-team initiative (e.g., with operations, technology, product, or credit).

Goal 7 – Technical Growth: Power BI & Production-Quality Analytics

Objective:
Strengthen technical capabilities to support production-quality analytics, dashboards, and experimentation.

Success measures:

Become proficient in Power BI and convert at least one existing manual/Excel-based report into a production Power BI dashboard adopted by stakeholders.

Standardize Python workflows for at least 2 key analyses (e.g., rule performance, spike investigations) with clear inputs/outputs.

Complete at least one structured learning activity (course or internal training) related to advanced analytics/experimentation and apply it in at least one project.
